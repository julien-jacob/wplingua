**While the free version supports translation into a single target language**, we set no boundaries on the number of words you can translate. 

Whether your website has a hundred pages or just a few, you can seamlessly make it accessible in the language you desire. 

###ü™Ñ Streamlined Setup Process ###

All you need to get started is to request your complimentary API key. Once you do, we'll promptly send it straight to your inbox. It's as straightforward as that! 

Our commitment is **to make multilingual capabilities accessible and effortless for every WordPress user**. 

Let us take care of the technicalities while you focus on creating captivating content for your global audience.

### üöÄ Optimized for international search engines (SEO) ###
When you use wpLingua on your website, all elements of your content - even those that are invisible - are translated.

wpLingua is "SEO-Friendly" because it takes care of translating:

‚úì Meta Title tags
‚úì Meta Description tags
‚úì Hreflang alternative links
‚úì Meta tags for social networks (Twitter X, OpenGraph Facebook...)
‚úì ALT attributes of images
‚úì And more.

By optimizing indexing, we ensure that your translated pages are not only understood by your audience, but are also easily found by search engines.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Tailor-made translations at your fingertips with our On-Page Editor ###
Although wpLingua gives you the convenience of **machine translations**, we understand the nuances of each language. 

wpLingua offers a canvas in which you can **refine each translation** so that it resonates with your unique voice and your brand message adapted to the cultural and contextual expectations of your audience. 

Experience the fusion of automation and the personal touch with our **visual on-page editor**.

### üé® Fully customizable language switcher ###
The wpLingua language selector is fully customizable. You can display the language switcher in two ways:

‚úì Automatic insertion via predefined positions
‚úì Use of a shortcode to display it wherever you want
‚úì Switcher in navigation menu with design defined by the theme

You can also control the appearance of the language switcher using:

‚úì Switcher styles (dropdown, inline, block...)
‚úì Predefined themes (light, dark, chameleon, etc.)
‚úì Configurable language names (translated name, original name, language ID, etc.)
‚úì Flag shapes (round, rectangle, wavy)
‚úì Language-based flag choices or import your own flag images
‚úì Adding custom CSS in a dedicated insert

With all these customization options, there's no way your website's language selector will look like any other!

### üìñ Translation rules by dictionary ###
The dictionary allows you to define translation rules that apply when generating machine translations. You can specify words or sets of words that should never be translated, or define how they should be translated for each language.

### üß≠ Intuitive possibilities to exclude certain translations ###
Navigate the complexities of website translation with wpLingua's intelligent exclusion feature. 

Want to preserve specific sections of a page in its original language? Our system seamlessly allows you to pinpoint and **exclude translations using CSS selectors**. 

If entire pages need to remain untouched, effortlessly exclude them by their URL. All of this can be managed with ease through our user-friendly exclusions manager. 

With wpLingua, you're always in command of what gets translated and what doesn't, ensuring your website's essence remains intact.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è The wpLingua API ###
The wpLingua plugin relies on our own wpLingua API, an integrated third-party service, to provide its machine translation functionality. The call to this Third Party Service (wpLingua API) is made when creating an API key from the plugin, during API key verification and when your website requests a new automatic translation (new texts discovered on a page web or request automatic translations from the translation edition). We invite you to consult our [Terms & Conditions page](https://wplingua.com/terms-and-conditions/) for more information.
