### 🔥 One free target language ###
The first language translation is completely free for non-commercial websites. If your website is of a commercial nature (e-commerce, advertising, etc.), a commercial licence is available.

### 🧮 No word limits! ###

Don't count the words on your website to decide which plan to choose, wpLingua doesn't limit them! Simply choose the number of target languages and translate without counting!

### 🚀 Optimized for international search engines (SEO) ###
When you use wpLingua on your website, all elements of your content - even those that are invisible - are translated.

wpLingua is "SEO-Friendly" because it takes care of translating:

✓ Meta Title tags
✓ Meta Description tags
✓ Hreflang alternative links
✓ Meta tags for social networks (Twitter X, OpenGraph Facebook...)
✓ ALT attributes of images
✓ And more.

By optimizing indexing, we ensure that your translated pages are not only understood by your audience, but are also easily found by search engines.

### 🪄 Streamlined Setup Process ###
Forget about complex plugins to set up, wpLingua enhances the user experience of the multilingual world. 

All you need to do to get started is request your machine translation API key, then play with the language switcher appearance options!

Let wpLingua take care of the technical aspects while you concentrate on creating compelling content for your international audience. Our commitment is **to make multilingual capabilities accessible and easy to use for all WordPress users**. 

### ✍️ Tailor-made translations at your fingertips with our On-Page Editor ###
Although wpLingua gives you the convenience of **machine translations**, we understand the nuances of each language. 

wpLingua allows you **to fine-tune each translation manually** if you need to.

Experience the fusion of automation and the personal touch with our **visual on-page editor**.

### 🔗 Editable URL translation ###
The plugin **automatically discovers URLs on your website and lets you translate them**. URLs are split into slugs (parts of the URL), making them easy to edit. This feature boosts SEO performance!

### 🎨 Fully customizable language switcher ###
wpLingua's language switcher is fully customizable. You can display the language selector in four ways:

✓ Automatic insertion via predefined positions.
✓ Use a shortcode to display it wherever you like.
✓ Insertion in the navigation menu using the design defined by the theme.
✓ Insertion in the navigation menu from the site editor using the Gutenberg block named Language Switcher

You can also control the appearance of the language switcher using:

✓ Switcher styles (dropdown, inline, block...)
✓ Predefined themes (light, dark, chameleon, etc.)
✓ Configurable language names (translated name, original name, language ID, etc.)
✓ Flag shapes (round, rectangle, wavy)
✓ Language-based flag choices or import your own flag images
✓ Adding custom CSS in a dedicated insert

With all these customization options, there's no way your website's language switcher will look like any other!

### 📖 Translation rules by dictionary ###
The dictionary allows you to define translation rules that apply when generating machine translations. You can specify words or sets of words that should never be translated, or define how they should be translated for each language.

### 🖼️ Translation of links and media ###
This feature lets you apply translation rules to links and media, offering even greater customization. You can display different images or modify link URLs according to the current language. These rules apply to the following elements: Link URLs, image URLs, iframe URLs and URLs in intercepted JSONs.

### 🧭 Intuitive possibilities to exclude certain translations ###
Navigate the complexities of website translation with wpLingua's intelligent exclusion feature. 

Want to preserve specific sections of a page in its original language? Our system seamlessly allows you to pinpoint and **exclude translations using CSS selectors**. 

If entire pages need to remain untouched, effortlessly exclude them by their URL. All of this can be managed with ease through our user-friendly exclusions manager. 

With wpLingua, you're always in command of what gets translated and what doesn't, ensuring your website's essence remains intact.

### ⚡️ The wpLingua API ###

We invite you to consult our [Terms & Conditions page](https://wplingua.com/terms-and-conditions/) for more information.
